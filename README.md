# Fluent-http

*This is the simplest fastest full fledged web server we could come up with.*

Fluent-http is a very capable web stack based on
[SimpleFramework](https://github.com/ngallagher/simpleframework) HTTP server.

Its goal is to provide everything a java web developer needs to build
modern web sites with REST back-ends and HTML5 front-ends.

## Our rules

Simple rules are used to develop fluent-http and we believe it's what
makes it a pleasure to use:

+ Starting a web server should be a one-liner
+ It should start at the speed of light
+ It should rely on a robust, fast http server
+ Using fluent-http should not imply using dozens of plugins and dependencies
+ Web standards should be baked-in

# Let's use it!

## Build status

- Linux: [![Java CI](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Environment

- `java-11`

## Maven

A single dependency is what it takes. Release versions are deployed on Maven Central:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.code-story</groupId>
  <artifactId>http</artifactId>
  <version>2.105</version>
</dependency>
```

# Show me some code!

## Hello World

Starting a web server that responds `Hello World` on `/` uri is as simple as:

```java
import net.codestory.http.WebServer;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new WebServer().configure(routes -> routes.get("/", "Hello World")).start();
  }
}
```

What this code does:

- It starts a web server on port `8080`
- To every `GET` requests on `/`, it will respond `Hello World`
as `text/html`
- To every other request it will respond a nice `404` error
- It serves everything in `$CURRENT_DIR/app` folder as static resources

Not too bad for a one-liner, right?

## More routes

Adding more routes is not hard either. It's based on Java 8 Lambdas:

```java
new WebServer().configure(routes -> routes
    .get("/", "Hello World")
    .get("/Test", (context) -> "Other Test")

    .url("/person")
      .get((context) -> new Person())
      .post((context) -> {
        Person person = context.extract(Person.class);
        // Do something
        return Payload.created();
      })

    .url("/company")
      .get((context) -> new Company())
      .post((context) -> {
        Company company = context.extract(Company.class);
        // Do something
        return Payload.created();
      })
).start();
```

## Path parameters

Routes can have path parameters:

```java
routes.get("/hello/:who", (context, who) -> "Hello " + who));
routes.get("/add/:first/to/:second", (context, first, second) -> Integer.parseInt(first) + Integer.parseInt(second));
```

## Query Parameters

Routes can also have query parameters:

```java
routes.get("/hello?who=:who", (who) -> "Hello " + who));
routes.get("/hello?to=:to&from=:from", (to, from) -> "Hello " + to + " from " + from));
```

## Lambda routes limitations

Notice that path and query parameters have to be of type `String`.
To overcome this limitation, fluent-http can be configured with
`Resource classes` instead of simple lambdas.

To sum up:

- The simpler syntax (`lambdas`) is very easy to read but comes with limitations.
- The more complex syntax (`Resource classes`) has no such limitation
and is very natural to people used to `Spring MVC` or `Jersey`.

## Resources

```java
...
routes.add(new PersonResource());
routes.add("calculation", new CalculationResource());
...

@Prefix("/person")
public class PersonResource {
  @Post("/")
  public void create(Person person) {
    // Do something
  }

  @Put("/:id")
  public Payload update(String id, Person person) {
    return new Payload(201);
  }

  @Get("/:id")
  public Person find(String id, Context context, Headers headers, Request request, Response response, Cookies cookies, Query query, User user) {
    Person person = ...
    return NotFoundException.notFoundIfNull(person);
  }
}

public class CalculationResource {
  @Get("/add/:first/to/:second")
  public int add(int first, int second) {
    return first + second;
  }
}
```

Each method annotated with `@Get`, `@Head`, `@Post`, `@Put`, `@Options` or `@Delete` is a route.
The method can have any name. The parameters must match the uri pattern.
Parameters names are not important but it's a good practice to match the uri placeholders.
The conversion between path parameters and method parameters is done with
[Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/).

We can also let the web server take care of the resource instantiation. It will create a singleton for each resource,
and recursively inject dependencies as singletons. It's a kind of poor's man DI framework, and be assured
that your favourite DI framework can be plugged in also.

```java
routes.add(CalculationResource.class);
```

## Header parameters

Resources can read values from header parameters. To do this, use `context.header("headerName")`:

````java
@Get("tokenFromHeader")
public User user(Context context) {
    return new Payload(context.header("token")).withCode(HttpStatus.OK);
}
````

## Sample projects

Before we take an in-depth look at fluent-http, you can go take a look
at samples [here](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-samples)
if it's how you prefer to learn.

## Production Mode vs Development mode

By default, fluent-http runs in `development` mode.

- It reloads the routes each time something changes in `app` folder
- It provides `.map` and `.source` for coffee and less files
- It serves [livereload](http://livereload.com/) protocol to refresh the browser on each static file change

In production mode:

- Stops looking for changes in `app` folder
- Doesn't serve `.map` and `.source` files
- It caches static resources as much as possible in memory
- It activates gzip compression on every request

We encourage you to use production mode whenever you deploy you website in real life and *not* activate it in dev mode.
To activate production mode, start the JVM with `-DPROD_MODE=true`.

## Static pages

When a web server is started, it automatically treats files found in `app` folder as static pages. The `app` folder
is searched first on the classpath (think `src/main/resources/app`) and then in the working directory.

So the simplest way to start a web server is in fact:

```java
import net.codestory.http.WebServer;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new WebServer().start();
  }
}
```

## Random port

Instead of relying on the default port, you can specify a port yourself.
(Not sure anyone does this anymore thanks to Docker containers.)

```java
new WebServer().start(4242);
```

... or you can also let the web server find a tcp port available.

```java
int port = new WebServer().startOnRandomPort().port();
```

This is specially helpful for integration tests running in parallel. Note that the way it finds a port available is
bulletproof on every OS. It chooses a random port, tries to start the web server and retries with a different port
in case of error. This is much more reliable than the usual technique that relies on:

```java
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);
int port = serverSocket.getLocalPort();
serverSocket.close();
```

## Not Only HTML

Fluent-http recognizes html files but not only. It is also able to transform more user-friendly file formats on the fly:

 + Html (`.html`)
 + Markdown (`.md` or `.markdown`) -> Compiled transparently to .html
 + Xml (`.xml`)
 + Json (`.json`)
 + Css (`.css`)
 + Less (`.less`) -> Compiled transparently to .css
 + Javascript (`.js`)
 + Coffeescript (`.coffee` or `litcoffee`) -> Compiled transparently to .js
 + Zip (`.zip`)
 + Gz (`.gz`)
 + Pdf (`.pdf`)
 + Gif (`.gif`)
 + Jpeg (`.jpeg` or `jpg`)
 + Png (`.png`)

All those file formats are served without additional configuration.
Files are served with automatic content-type, etag and last-modified
headers. And you can override them of course.

## Webjars

Fluent-http supports [WebJars](http://www.webjars.org/) to serve static assets.
Just add a maven dependency to a `WebJar` and reference the static resource in your pages with the `/webjars/` prefix.

Here's an example with Bootstrap:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
  <artifactId>bootstrap</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.2</version>
</dependency>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/webjars/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <script src="/webjars/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Or better yet, use the `[[webjar]]` handlebars helper to set the version dynamically:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  [[webjar bootstrap.min.js]]
</head>
</html>
```

The `[[webjar]]` helper also supports a list as parameter:

```html
---
bootstrapAssets: [
  bootstrap.min.css,
  bootstrap.min.js
]
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  [[webjar bootstrapAssets]]
</head>
</html>
```

## Yaml Front Matter

Static pages can use Yaml Front Matter as in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). For example this `index.md`
file:

```markdown
---
greeting: Hello
to: World
---
[[greeting]] [[to]]
```

Will be rendered as:

```html
<p>Hello World</p>
```

Take a look at `Jekyll` to understand the full power of `Yaml Front Matter`.
It makes it very easy to build static pages without duplication.

## Handlebars

To make Yaml Front Matter even more useful, static pages can use [HandleBar](http://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine.

```markdown
---
names: [Doc, Grumpy, Happy]
---
[[#each names]]
 - [[.]]
[[/each]]
```

Will be rendered as:

```html
<ul>
<li><p>Doc</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grumpy</p>
</li>
<li><p>Happy</p>
</li>
</ul>
```

`Handlebars` syntax can be used in `.html` or `.md` files. You can
use the [built-in helpers](http://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java/helpers.html) or add
your own helpers.

Note that because our stack is meant to be used with js frameworks like
AngularJs, we couldn't stick with standard `{{}}` handlebars notation.
We use the `[[]]` syntax instead, It makes it possible to mix server-side templates
with client-side templates on the same page.

## Layouting

Like in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), pages can be decorated with a layout. The name of the layout should be configured
in the `Yaml Front Matter` section.

For example, given this `app/_layouts/default.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
[[body]]
</body>
</html>
```

and this `app/index.md` file:

```markdown
---
layout: default
---
Hello World
```

A request to `/` will give this result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

A layout file can be a `.html`, `.md`, `.markdown` or `.txt` file. It should be put in `app/_layouts` folder.
The layout name used in the `Yaml Front Matter` section can omit the layout file extension.
Layouts are recursive, ie a layout file can have a layout.

A decorating layout can use variables defined in the rendered file. Here's an example with an html title:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>[[title]]</title>
</head>
<body>
  [[body]]
</body>
</html>
```

and this `app/index.md` file:

```markdown
---
title: Greeting
layout: default
---
Hello World
```

A request to `/` will give this result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Greeting</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Site variables

In addition to the variables defined in the Yaml Front Matter section, some site-wide variables are available.

 - All variables defined in the `app/_config.yml` file,
 - The handlebars `site.data` variable is a map of every file in `app/_data/` parsed and indexed by its file name (without extension),
 - `site.pages` is a list of all static pages in `app/`. Each entry is a map containing all variables in the file's YFM section, plus `content`, `path` and `name` variables.
 - `site.tags` is a map of every tag defined in static pages YMF sections. For each tag, there's the list of the pages with this tag. Pages can have multiple tags.
 - `site.categories`is a map of every category defined in static pages YMF sections. For each category, there's the list of the pages with this category. Pages can have one or zero category.

## Dynamic pages

Ok, so its easy to mimic the behaviour of a static website generated with
Jekyll. But what about dynamic pages? Turns it's easy too.

Let's create a `hello.md` page with an unbound variable.

```markdown
Hello [[name]]
```

If we query `/hello`, the name will be replaced with an empty string since nowhere does it say what its value is. The solution is to override the default route to `/hello` as is:

```java
routes.get("/hello", Model.of("name", "Bob"));
```

Now, when the page is rendered, `[[name]]` will be replaced server-side with `Bob`.

If not specified, the name of the page (ie. the view) to render for a given uri is guessed after the uri. Files are
looked up in this order: `uri`, `uri.html`, `uri.md`, `uri.markdown` then `uri.txt`. Most of the time
it will *just work*, but the view can of course be overridden:

```java
routes.get("/hello/:whom", (context, whom) -> ModelAndView.of("greeting", "name", whom));
```

## Content-type right out of the box

A route can return any `Object`, the server will guess the response's type:

 - `java.lang.String` is interpreted as inline html with content type `text/html;charset=UTF-8`.
 - `byte[]` is interpreted as `application/octet-stream`.
 - `java.io.InputStream` is interpreted as `application/octet-stream`.
 - `java.io.File` and `java.nio.file.Path` are interpreted as a static file. The content type is guessed from the file's extension.
 - `java.net.URL` is interpreted as a classpath resource. The content type is guessed from the resource's extension.
 - `Model` is interpreted as a template which name is guessed, rendered with given variables. The content type is
 guessed from the file's extension.
 - `ModelAndView` is interpreted as a template with given name, rendered with given variables. The content type is
 guessed from the file's extension.
 - `void` is empty content.
 - any other type is serialized to json, using `Jackson`, with content type `application/json;charset=UTF-8`.

## Payload

For a finer control over the response of a route, one can return a `Payload` object rather than an `Object`.
Using a payload, one can set headers, cookies, content type and actual response.

```java
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.ok());
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.seeOther("/anotherUri"));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> new Payload("Hello"));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> new Payload("text/html", "Hello", 200));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> new Payload("text/html", "Hello", 200).withCookie("key", "value"));
...
```

## Cookies

Cookies can be read on the request and sent on the response.

To read the cookies, you either ask through the `Context` (mainly for lambda routes).

```java
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.cookies().value("name"));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.cookies().value("name", "default"));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.cookies().value("name", 42));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.cookies().value("user", User.class));
routes.get("/hello", (context) -> Payload.cookies().keyValues());
```

Or, for annotated resources, directly get an instance of `Cookies` injected.

```java
public class MyResource {
  @Post("/uri")
  public void action(Cookies cookies) {
    String value = cookies.value("name", "Default value");
    ...
  }
}
```

To add a cookie to a response, use a `withCookie(...)` method on the `Payload`:

```java
return new Payload(...).withCookie("key", "value");
return new Payload(...).withCookie("key", 42);
return new Payload(...).withCookie("key", new Person(...));
...
```

## POST

Now that the website is dynamic, we might also want to post data. We support `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` methods.
Here's how one would support posting data:

```java
routes.post("/person", context -> {
  String name = context.query().get("name");
  int age = context.query().getInteger("age");

  Person person = new Person(name, age);
  // do something

  return Payload.created();
});
```

It's much easier to let [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) do the mapping between form parameters and Java Beans.

```java
routes.post("/person", context -> {
  Person person = context.extract(Person.class);
  // do something

  return Payload.created();
});
```

Using the annotated resource syntax, it's even simpler:

```java
public class PersonResource {
  @Post("/person")
  public void create(Person person) {
    repository.add(person);
  }
}
```

Multiple methods can match the same uri:

```java
public class PersonResource {
  @Get("/person/:id")
  public Model show(String id) {
    return Model.of("person", repository.find(id));
  }

  @Put("/person/:id")
  public void update(String id, Person person) {
    repository.update(person);
  }
}
```

Same goes for the lambda syntax:

```java
routes
  .get("/person/:id", (context, id) -> Model.of("person", repository.find(id)))
  .put("/person/:id", (context, id) -> {
    Person person = context.extract(Person.class);
    repository.update(person);
    return Payload.created();
  });
}
```

Or to avoid duplication:

```java
routes
  .url("/person/:id")
    .get((context, id) -> Model.of("person", repository.find(id)))
    .put((context, id) -> {
      Person person = context.extract(Person.class);
      repository.update(person);
      return Payload.created();
    });
}
```

## Etag

Etag headers computation is automatic on every query. Each time a non streaming response is made by the server, 
etag headers are added automatically. It's performed by the default `PayloadWriter` implementation.

Each time a query is made with etag headers, the server can decide whether to return a `302 Not Modified` code
or not.

If you want to implement a different etag strategy, you have to provide your own implementation of `PayloadWriter`.

```java
routes.setExtensions(new Extensions() {
  public PayloadWriter createPayloadWriter(Request request, Response response, Env env, Site site, Resources resources, CompilerFacade compilers) {
    return new PayloadWriter(request, response, env, site, resources, compilers) {
      protected String etag(byte[] data) {
        return Md5.of(data);
      }
      
      ...
    };
}));
```

## SSL

Starting the web server in SSL mode is very easy. You need a certificate file (`.crt`) and a private key file (`.der`),
That's it. No need to import anything in a stupid keystore. It cannot be easier!

```java
new WebServer().startSSL(9443, Paths.get("server.crt"), Paths.get("server.der"));
```

It is also possible to use a TLS certificate chain with intermediate CA certificates:

```java
new WebServer().startSSL(9443, Arrays.asList(Paths.get("server.crt"), Paths.get("subCA.crt")),
                              Paths.get("server.der")
                        );
```

When an authentication with a client certificate is required, it is possible to specify a list of accepted trust anchor certificates:

```java
new WebServer().startSSL(9443, Arrays.asList(
                              Paths.get("server.crt"), Paths.get("subCA.crt")),
                              Paths.get("server.der"), 
                              Arrays.asList(Paths.get("trustAnchor.crt"))
                        );
```

Note that, as of now, we only accept `rsa` key file in `PKCS#8` format in a `.der` binary file.

## Errors

You have probably noticed, fluent-http comes with pre-packaged, kitten-ready" 404 & 500 error pages.

If you want to customize these pages or are member of the CCC "Comité Contre les Chats", just put a `404.html` or `500.html` at the root of your `app` folder and they will be served instead of the defaults.

## Json support

Json is supported as a first class citizen. Producing json is as easy as this:

```java
routes.get("/product", () -> new Product(...));
routes.get("/products", () -> Arrays.asList(new Product(...), new Product(...)));
```

These routes serve the Products serialized as json using [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/).
The content type will be `application/json;charset=UTF-8`.

## ObjectMapper Customization

When fluent-http talks json, the [jackson json processor](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) is used.
Sometimes (meaning: always in any decent sized project), you want to  provide your own home-cooked `ObjectMapper`.
You can do this by configuring or replacing the ObjectMapper through the `Extensions` interface.

```java
routes.setExtensions(new Extensions() {
  @Override
  public ObjectMapper configureOrReplaceObjectMapper(ObjectMapper defaultObjectMapper, Env env) {
    defaultObjectMapper.registerModule(new JSR310Module())
    .configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false);
    
    return defaultObjectMapper;
  }
});
```

## Filters

Cross-cutting behaviours can be implemented with filters. For example, one can log every request to the server
with this filter:

```java
routes.filter((uri, context, next) -> {
  System.out.println(uri);
  return next.get();
})
```

A filter can be defined in its own class:

```java
routes.filter(LogRequestFilter.class);

public class LogRequestFilter implements Filter {
  @Override
  public Payload apply(String uri, Context context, PayloadSupplier next) throws Exception {
    System.out.println(uri);
    return next.get();
  }
}
```

A filter can either pass to the next filter/route by returning `next.get()` or it can totally bypass the chain of
filters/routes by returning its own Payload. For example, a Basic Authentication filter would look like:

```java
public class BasicAuthFilter implements Filter {
  private final String uriPrefix;
  private final String realm;
  private final List<String> hashes;

  public BasicAuthFilter(String uriPrefix, String realm, Map<String, String> users) {
    this.uriPrefix = uriPrefix;
    this.realm = realm;
    this.hashes = new ArrayList<>();

    users.forEach((String user, String password) -> {
      String hash = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString((user + ":" + password).getBytes());

      hashes.add("Basic " + hash);
    });
  }

  @Override
  public Payload apply(String uri, Context context, PayloadSupplier nextFilter) throws Exception {
    if (!uri.startsWith(uriPrefix)) {
      return nextFilter.get(); // Ignore
    }

    String authorizationHeader = context.getHeader("Authorization");
    if ((authorizationHeader == null) || !hashes.contains(authorizationHeader.trim())) {
      return Payload.unauthorized(realm);
    }

    return nextFilter.get();
  }
}
```

Both `BasicAuthFilter` and `LogRequestFilter` are pre-packaged filters that you can use in your applications.

## Dependency Injection

### With Guice

Out of the box support for Guice: just throw in your Guice dependency in your pom, and you're ready to roll.

Let's say you got some Guice Module like this.

```Java
public class ServiceModule extends AbstractModule {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(MongoDB.class);

        bind(AllProducts.class);
        bind(AllOrders.class);
        bind(AllEmails.class);
  }
}
```

Wiring them in can be done in your WebConfiguration like this

```Java
public void configure(Routes routes) {
        routes.setIocAdapter(new GuiceAdapter(new ServiceModule()));
        routes.get("/foobar", "<h1>FOO BAR FTW</h1>");
}
```

Now you can inject your beans like you would expect

```Java
public class AllProducts {
    private final MongoCollection products;

    @Inject
    public AllProducts(MongoDB mongodb) {
        products = mongodb.getJongo().getCollection("product");
    }
```

### With Spring

We support Spring injected bean in exactly the same manner as with guice.
Check the [SpringAdapter](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http/blob/master/src/main/java/net/codestory/http/injection/SpringAdapter.java) class, which works the same way as its Guice counterpart.

Look at the [SpringAdapterTest](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http/blob/master/src/test/java/net/codestory/http/injection/SpringAdapterTest.java) we wrote for a working example.

## HandleBars extensions

You'll probably sooner than later want to add to some custom HandleBars [helpers](http://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html) for your server-side templates.

You first start to write you own helper in Java.
```Java
import com.github.jknack.handlebars.Helper;
import com.github.jknack.handlebars.Options;
.../...

public enum HandleBarHelper implements Helper<Object> {
    appStoreClassSuffix {
        @Override
        public CharSequence apply(Object context, Options options) throws IOException {
            if (((String) context).contains("google"))
                return "_play";
            else
                return "_ios";
        }
    },
    .../...
}
```

You wire it in by adding your helper class to the `CompilersConfiguration` by the way of the `Extensions` interface.

```Java
routes
  .setExtensions(new Extensions() {
    @Override
    public void configureCompilers(CompilersConfiguration compilers, Env env) {
      compilers.addHandlebarsHelpers(HandleBarHelper.class);
      compilers.addHandlebarsHelpers(AnotherHelper.class);
    }
  })
```

You are able to use your own helper in any of your template like this example for the code above.

```html
<a href="[[appStoreUrl]]" class="btn_appstore[[appStoreClassSuffix appStoreUrl]]"></a>
```

### Default provided helpers

`fluent-http` comes with some build-in handlebars helpers, to make your life easier:

* `livereload` which provides the livereload client-side js script. `[[livereload]]` is already injected in the `default` layout.
* `GoogelAnalytics` which provides client-side injection of the google analytics script. Use it like that: `[[google_analytics 'UA-XXXXXX-X']]`
* `StringHelper` which provides `[[capitalizeFirst]]`, `[[lower]]`, `[[stringFormat ]]` check the [documentation](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/blob/master/handlebars/src/main/java/com/github/jknack/handlebars/helper/StringHelpers.java)
* TODO: `css`, `script`

## Caching

fluent-http uses a disk cache to store `.css` and `.js` files produced from `.less` or .`coffee` files.
This directory is by default stored in your "user home" in a `.code-story` directory.

If you don't want it to be here you can `-Duser.home=/foo/bar` as you see fit.
If you're paranoid and run fluent-http under `nobody` user make sure `nobody` can read/write this directory.

### Code Samples

* Configure the threads of the underlying `SimpleHttpServer`: [ThreadConfigurationSample.java](src/test/java/net/codestory/http/samples/ThreadConfigurationSample.java)
