# Environment

- `java-1.8`

# Usage

One of our goals was to make it as easy as possible to start with.

## Maven

Release versions are deployed on Maven Central:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.code-story</groupId>
  <artifactId>http</artifactId>
  <version>2.47</version>
</dependency>
```

## Sample projects

Sample projects can be found [here](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-samples).

## Hello World

Starting a web server that responds `Hello World` on `/` uri is as simple as that:

```java
import net.codestory.http.WebServer;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new WebServer().configure(routes -> routes.get("/", "Hello World")).start();
  }
}
```

Adding more routes is not hard either:

```java
new WebServer().configure(routes -> routes.
    get("/", "Hello World").
    get("/Test", "Test").
    get("/OtherTest", "Other Test")
).start();
```

## Path parameters

Routes can have path parameters:

```java
routes.get("/hello/:who", (context, name) -> "Hello " + name));
routes.get("/add/:first/to/:second", (context, first, second) -> Integer.parseInt(first) + Integer.parseInt(second));
```

Notice that path parameters have to be of type `String`.

## Query Parameters

Routes can have query parameters:

```java
routes.get("/hello?who=:who", (who) -> "Hello " + who));
routes.get("/hello?to=:to&from=:from", (to, from) -> "Hello " + to + " from " + from));
```
Notice that query parameters can be issued in any order.

## Resources

The notation with lambdas is very compact but cannot support path parameters of type other than `String`. So we've added
the notion of Resource, in a way similar to jaxb.

```java
routes.add(new CalculationResource());

public class CalculationResource {
  @Get("/add/:first/to/:second")
  public int add(int first, int second) {
    return first + second;
  }
}
```

Each method annotated with `@Get` is a route. The method can have any name. The parameters must match the uri
pattern. Parameters names are not important but it's a good practice to match the uri placeholders. The conversion between
path parameters and method parameters is done with [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/).

We can also let the web server take care of the resource instantiation. It will create a singleton for each resource,
and recursively inject dependencies as singletons. It's a kind of poor's man DI framework.

```java
routes.add(CalculationResource.class);
```

## Static pages

When a web server is started, it automatically treats files found in `app` folder as static pages. The `app` folder
is searched first on the classpath and then in the working directory.
So the simplest way to start a web server is in fact:

```java
import net.codestory.http.WebServer;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new WebServer().start();
  }
}
```

## Random port

Instead of relying on the default port, you can specify the port yourself...

```java
new WebServer().start(4242);
```

... or you can also let the web server find a tcp port available.

```java
int port = new WebServer().startOnRandomPort().port();
```

This is specially helpful for integration tests running in parallel. Not that the way it finds a port available is
bulletproof on every OS. It chooses a random port, tries to start the web server and retries with a different port
in case of error. This is much more reliable than the usual technique that relies on:

```java
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);
int port = serverSocket.getLocalPort();
serverSocket.close();
```

## NOHTML (Not Only HTML)

The web server recognizes html files but not only. It is also able to transform more user-friendly file formats on the fly:

 + Html (`.html`)
 + Markdown (`.md` or `.markdown`) -> Html
 + Xml (`.xml`)
 + Css (`.css`)
 + Less (`.less`) -> Css
 + Javascript (`.js`)
 + Coffeescript (`.coffee` or `litcoffee`) -> Javascript
 + Zip (`.zip`)
 + Gz (`.gz`)
 + Pdf (`.pdf`)
 + Gif (`.gif`)
 + Jpeg (`.jpeg` or `jpg`)
 + Png (`.png`)
 + All other files are treated as plain text.

## Yaml Front Matter

Static pages can use Yaml Front Matter as in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). For example this `index.md`
file:

```markdown
---
greeting: Hello
to: World
---
[[greeting]] [[to]]
```

Will be rendered as:

```html
<p>Hello World</p>
```

## Handlebars

To make Yaml Front Matter even more useful, static pages can use [HandleBar](http://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine.

```markdown
---
names: [Doc, Grumpy, Happy]
---
[[#each names]]
 - [[.]]
[[/each]]
```

Will be rendered as:

```html
<ul>
<li><p>Doc</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grumpy</p>
</li>
<li><p>Happy</p>
</li>
</ul>
```

## Layouting

Like in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), pages can be decorated with a layout. The name of the layout should be configured
in the Yaml Front Matter section.

For example, given this `app/_layouts/default.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
[[body]]
</body>
</html>
```

and this `app/index.md` file:

```markdown
---
layout: default
---
Hello World
```

A request to `/` will give this result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

A layout file can be a `.html`, `.md`, `.markdown` or `.txt` file. It should be put in `app/_layouts` folder.
The layout name used in the Yaml Front Matter section can omit the layout file extension.
Layouts are recursive, ie a layout file can have a layout.

A layout can use variables defined in the rendered file. Here's an example with an html title:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>[[title]]</title>
</head>
<body>
  [[body]]
</body>
</html>
```

and this `app/index.md` file:

```markdown
---
title: Greeting
layout: default
---
Hello World
```

A request to `/` will give this result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Greeting</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Site variables

In addition to the variables defined in the Yaml Front Matter section, some site-wide variables are available.

 - All variables defined in the `app/_config.yml` file
 - `site.data` is a map of every file in `app/_data/` parsed and indexed by its file name (without extension)
 - `site.pages` is a list of all static pages in `app/`. Each entry is a map containing all variables in the file's YFM section, plus `content`, `path` and `name` variables.
 - `site.tags` is a map of every tag defined in static pages YMF sections. For each tag, there's the list of the pages with this tag. Pages can have multiple tags.
 - `site.categories`is a map of every category defined in static pages YMF sections. For each category, there's the list of the pages with this category. Pages can have one or zero category.

## Webjars

We also support [WebJars](http://www.webjars.org/) to server static assets.
Just add a maven dependency to a WebJar and reference the static resource in your pages with the `/webjars/` prefix.

Here's an example with Bootstrap:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
  <artifactId>bootstrap</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/webjars/bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Dynamic pages

Ok, so its easy to mimic the behavior of a static website generated with Jekyll. But what about dynamic pages? Turns
out it's heasy too.

Let's create a `hello.md` page with an unbound variable.

```markdown
Hello [[name]]
```

If we query `/hello`, the name will be replaced with an empty string since nowhere does it say what its value is. The solution
is to override the default route to `/hello` as is:

```java
routes.get("/hello", Model.of("name", "Bob"));
```

Now, when the pages is rendered, `[[name]]` will be replaced server-side with `Bob`.

If not specified, the name of the page (ie. the view) to render for a given uri is guessed after the uri. Files are
looked up in this order: `uri`, `uri.html`, `uri.md`, `uri.markdown` then `uri.txt`. Most of the time
it will *just work*, but the view can of course be overridden:

```java
routes.get("/hello/:whom", (context, whom) -> ModelAndView.of("greeting", "name", whom));
```

## Return types

A route can return any Object, the server will try to guess what to do with it:

 - `java.lang.String` is interpreted as inline html with content type `text/html;charset=UTF-8`.
 - `byte[]` is interpreted as `application/octet-stream`.
 - `java.io.InputStream` is interpreted as `application/octet-stream`.
 - `java.io.File` is interpreted as a static file. The content type is guessed from file's extension.
 - `java.nio.file.Path` is interpreted as a static file. The content type is guessed from file's extension.
 - `Model` is interpreted as a template which name is guessed, rendered with given variables. The content type is
 guessed from file's extension.
 - `ModelAndView` is interpreted as a template with given name, rendered with given variables. The content type is
 guessed from file's extension.
 - `void` is empty content.
 - any other type is serialized to json with content type `application/json;charset=UTF-8`.

## POST

Now that the website is dynamic, we might also want to post data. We support `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` methods.
Here's how one would post data.

```java
routes.post("/person", context -> {
  String name = context.get("name");
  int age = context.getInteger("age");

  Person person = new Person(name, age);
  // do something

  return Payload.created();
});
```

It's even easier to let [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) do the mapping between form parameters and Java Beans.

```java
routes.post("/person", context -> {
  Person person = context.contentAs(Person.class);
  // do something

  return Payload.created();
});
```

Using the annotated resource syntax, it's even simpler:

```java
public class PersonResource {
  @Post("/person")
  public void create(Person person) {
    repository.add(person);
  }
}
```

Multiple methods can be used for the same uri:

```java
public class PersonResource {
  @Get("/person/:id")
  public Model show(String id) {
    return Model.of("person", repository.find(id));
  }

  @Put("/person/:id")
  public void update(String id, Person person) {
    repository.update(person);
  }
}
```

Same goes for the lambda syntax:

```java
routes.
  get("/person/:id", (context, id) -> Model.of("person", repository.find(id))).
  put("/person/:id", (context, id) -> {
    Person person = context.contentAs(Person.class);
    repository.update(person);

    return Payload.created();
  });
}
```

Or to avoid duplication:

```java
routes
  .with("/person/:id").
    get((context, id) -> Model.of("person", repository.find(id))).
    put((context, id) -> {
      Person person = context.contentAs(Person.class);
      repository.update(person);

      return Payload.created();
    });
}
```

## SSL

Starting the web server in SSL mode is very easy. You need a certificate file (`.crt`) and a private key file (`.der`),
That's it. No need to import anything in a stupid keystore. It cannot be easier!

```java
new Webserver().startSSL(9443, Paths.get("server.crt"), Paths.get("server.der"));
```

It is also possible to use a TLS certificate chain with intermediate CA certificates

```java
new Webserver().startSSL(9443, Arrays.asList(Paths.get("server.crt"), Paths.get("subCA.crt")), Paths.get("server.der"));
```

When an authentication with a client certificate is required, it is possible to specify a list of accepted trust anchor certificates

```java
new Webserver().startSSL(9443, Arrays.asList(Paths.get("server.crt"), Paths.get("subCA.crt")), Paths.get("server.der"), Arrays.asList(Paths.get("trustAnchor.crt")));
```

## Errors

You have probably noticed, fluent-http comes with pre-rendered kitten ready 404 & 500 error pages.

If you want to customize this pages or are member of the CCC "Comité Contre les Chats" then you'll probably want to override them.
Just put a 404.html or 500.html at the root of your app folder and they will be served instead of the kitten's one.

## Json support

Json is supported as a first class citizen. Producing json is as easy as this:

```java
routes.get("/products", () -> Arrays.asList(new Product(...), new Product(...)));
```

This route serves the Products serialized as json using [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/).
The content type will be `application/json;charset=UTF-8`.

## ObjectMapper customization

When fluent-http talks json, the [jackson json processor](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) is not far.
Sometimes (meaning: Always in any decent sized project), you want to  provide your own home-cooked `ObjectMapper`.
You can do this by configuring or replacing the ObjectMapper through the `Extensions` interface.

Like the example below, for instance let's say someone, let's name it Cedric, wants to map objects using the "new" jdk8
 date api. He can do so by using :

```java
routes.setExtensions(new Extensions() {
  @Override
  public ObjectMapper configureOrReplaceObjectMapper(ObjectMapper defaultObjectMapper, Env env) {
    defaultObjectMapper.registerModule(new JSR310Module())
    .configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false);
    return defaultObjectMapper;
  }
});
```

## Filters

Cross-cutting behaviors can be implemented with filters. For example, one can log every request to the server
with this filter:

```java
routes.filter((uri, context, next) -> {
  System.out.println(uri);
  return next.get();
})
```

A filter can be defined in its own class:

```java
routes.filter(LogRequestFilter.class);

public class LogRequestFilter implements Filter {
  @Override
  public Payload apply(String uri, Context context, PayloadSupplier next) throws IOException {
    System.out.println(uri);
    return next.get();
  }
}
```

A filter can either pass to the next filter/route by returning `next.get()` or it can totally bypass the chain of
filters/routes by returning its own Payload. For example, a Basic Authentication filter would look like:

```java
public class BasicAuthFilter implements Filter {
  private final String uriPrefix;
  private final String realm;
  private final List<String> hashes;

  public BasicAuthFilter(String uriPrefix, String realm, Map<String, String> users) {
    this.uriPrefix = uriPrefix;
    this.realm = realm;
    this.hashes = new ArrayList<>();

    users.forEach((String user, String password) -> {
      String hash = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString((user + ":" + password).getBytes());

      hashes.add("Basic " + hash);
    });
  }

  @Override
  public Payload apply(String uri, Context context, PayloadSupplier nextFilter) throws IOException {
    if (!uri.startsWith(uriPrefix)) {
      return nextFilter.get(); // Ignore
    }

    String authorizationHeader = context.getHeader("Authorization");
    if ((authorizationHeader == null) || !hashes.contains(authorizationHeader.trim())) {
      return Payload.unauthorized(realm);
    }

    return nextFilter.get();
  }
}
```

Both `BasicAuthFilter` and `LogRequestFilter` are pre-packaged filters that you can use in your applications.

## Dependency Injection

### With Guice

Out of the box support for Guice: just throw in your Guice dependency in your pom, and you're ready to roll.

Let's say you got some Guice Module like this.

```Java
public class ServiceModule extends AbstractModule {

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(MongoDB.class);

        bind(AllProducts.class);
        bind(AllOrders.class);
        bind(AllEmails.class);
  }
}
```

Wiring them in can be done in your WebConfiguration like this

```Java
public void configure(Routes routes) {
        routes.setIocAdapter(new GuiceAdapter(new ServiceModule()));
        routes.get("/foobar", "<h1>FOO BAR FTW</h1>");
}
```

Now you can inject your bean like you would expect

```Java
public class AllProducts {
    private final MongoCollection products;

    @Inject
    public AllProducts(MongoDB mongodb) {
        products = mongodb.getJongo().getCollection("product");
    }
```

### With Spring

## Markdown extensions

TODO (Formulas, Tables, ...)

## HandleBars extensions

You'll be probably sooner than later wanting to have access to some custom HandleBars [helpers](http://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html) for your Server Side templates.

You first start to write you own helper in Java.
```Java
import com.github.jknack.handlebars.Helper;
import com.github.jknack.handlebars.Options;
.../...

public enum HandleBarHelper implements Helper<Object> {

    appStoreClassSuffix {

        @Override
        public CharSequence apply(Object context, Options options) throws IOException {
            if (((String) context).contains("google"))
                return "_play";
            else
                return "_ios";
        }

    },
    .../...

}
```

You wire it in, by declaring your class in the `handleBarHelper` property inside your `app/_config.yml` file.
As of now, you can only have one class declared here, but as shown above this can be an `enum` so you can declare as many as you want inside one.
```yaml
handleBarHelper: com.foobar.HandleBarHelper
```

You are able to use your own helper in any of your template like this example for the code above.
```html
<a href="[[appStoreUrl]]" class="btn_appstore[[appStoreClassSuffix appStoreUrl]]"></a>
```

Note that we provide quite a few helper by default like the [StringHelper](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/blob/master/handlebars/src/main/java/com/github/jknack/handlebars/helper/StringHelpers.java) which provides quite a few things already

## Caching

fluent-http uses a disk cache to store css and js files produced from less or coffeescript.
This directory is by default stored in your "user home" in a .code-story directory.

If you don't want it to be here you can `-Duser.home=/foo/bar` as you see fit.
If you're paranoid and run fluent-http under `nobody` user make sure `nobody` can read/write this directory.
